# Project Description

Dan's Utility Library is a collection of reusable code that I've written or found throughout my programming career.

You can find these libraries on NuGet:
[Dan's C# Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DansUtilityLibraries.CSharpLibrary/)
[Dan's WPF Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DansUtilityLibraries.WpfLibrary/)

These libraries were inspired by [Craig's Utility Library](cul.codeplex.com), which is the same concept as this and has tons of useful code.
